# SpringBoot art NFT Data API 

The purpose of this starter project is the creation of a Springboot API able to perform CRUD operations on a simple database designed to
house metadata embedded in art non-fungible tokens (NFTs). 

The project was inspired by artist Dmitri Cherniak, who produced a series of 1,000 
generative art NFTs in a series called "Ringers", each of which contains abstract metadata loosely related to features of the artworks themselves. An example of one such work is below: 
  
Screenshots of Postman requests to the API can be found here:

![put](/documentation/put_request.png)  
![delete](/documentation/delete_request.png)

o	Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.
* Expanding the set of properties available for each NFT, and more descriptive values that provide improved descriptions of each attribute
* Expanding the database to encompass more data entries, more tables and a full schema. 
* A simple front end to allow users to intuitively interact with the API
* More custom API reuquests to increase functionality available 
* Increased test coverage
