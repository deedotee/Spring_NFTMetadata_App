# SpringBoot NFT Data API 

The purpose of this starter project is the creation of a Springboot API able to perform CRUD operations on a simple database designed to
house metadata embedded in art non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Timeframe for building the API was five days (11th - 15th July 2022). 
The project was inspired by artist Dmitri Cherniak, who produced a series of 1,000 
generative art NFTs in a series called "Ringers", each of which contains abstract metadata loosely related to features of the artworks themselves. 

I expected the challenge to take a while to complete given the number of steps involved in configuring and testing the API.  

o	Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.
* Expanding the database to encompass more data entries, more tables and a full schema. 
* A simple front end to allow users to intuitively interact with the API
* More custom API reuqests to increase functionality available 

o	Screenshots showing your postman requests and the output from the API.
o	Screenshots of your database to prove that data is being persisted.
o	Screenshot of your test results, including coverage report. [name]
